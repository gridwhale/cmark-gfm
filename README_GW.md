Tips on Building
================

* Pull a fresh copy of the repo (I'm not sure how to clean).
* Make sure you run under the x64 command-line environment
* Run nmake, which will generate the makefiles and compile.
* Edit build/CMakeCache.txt and change the compiler flags to use the Multithreaded Static library (/MT)
